# Void - RLGym_PPO

The RLGym_PPO / RLGym 1 and 2

This project mainly is an experimentation for metrics logging, be it with rlgym1 or 2

:warning: This version requires a forked version of RLGym v2 until the api is fully released. Using a normal RLGym v2 will result in an error if you use shot and save loggers.
